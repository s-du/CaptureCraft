# PaintLCM
Image generation based on screen capture and/or simple brush strokes. The Gradio code from <a>https://github.com/flowtyone/flowty-realtime-lcm-canvas</a> was adapted to Pyside6, and upgraded with screen capture functionality.

<img src="paintlcm_lr3.gif" width="500" alt="Description">

## Usage
Screen capture a 512 x 512 window on any app (can be adapted depending on your GPU). Then, paint with brush or add simple shapes and see the proposed image adapting live.
CTRL + wheel to adapt cursor size. The SD model can be adapted in the lcm.py file.
Voil√†!

NB: Working with Pyside 6.5.2
